## Testing Strategy

Each stage includes:
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for connected features
- Performance benchmarks where applicable
- Security testing for sensitive operations

## Quality Gates

Before moving to next stage:
- All tests passing
- Code review completed
- Performance metrics met
- Security requirements satisfied
- Documentation updated

## Development Guidelines

1. **Version Control**
   - Feature branches for each component
   - Pull request reviews required
   - Semantic versioning

2. **Code Quality**
   - TypeScript strict mode enabled
   - ESLint rules enforced
   - Test coverage requirements met

3. **Documentation**
   - Code documentation updated
   - API documentation maintained
   - README updates for new features

4. **Performance**
   - Performance testing at each stage
   - Optimization opportunities identified
   - Metrics logged and monitored

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Environments**
   - Development
   - Staging
   - Production

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Automated deployments via CI/CD
   - Rollback procedures defined
   - Monitoring in place

## Risk Mitigation

- Regular backups of development data
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Rate limit monitoring
- Error tracking and logging

## Success Criteria

Each stage must meet:
- Functional requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Security standards
- Code quality metrics
- Documentation requirements

## Timeline Considerations

- Each stage estimated at 1-2 weeks
- Buffer time included for unexpected issues
- Regular progress reviews
- Flexible prioritization based on feedback

This process is designed to be iterative and can be adjusted based on project needs and feedback during development.
